# Engineering Out Loud

* [Season 1: Episode 5](http://engineering.oregonstate.edu/episode-5-odds-ends)

  The Monte Carlo method conjures images of a suave gambler beating the house in Monaco. In reality, Monte Carlo methods are computational algorithms that use randomness to solve problems. 

  In this episode we hear from [Todd Palmer](http://ne.oregonstate.edu/todd-s-palmer), professor of nuclear engineering, about his use of Monte Carlo simulations in nuclear fuel research. In addition, find out how [Haizhong Wang](http://cce.oregonstate.edu/wang), assistant professor in transportation engineering, is incorporating Monte Carlo to model tsunami evacuation routes in the Cascadia Subduction Zone.

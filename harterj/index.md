Jackson R. Harter
================================

### My name is Jackson.
I am a 2nd year PhD student at Oregon State. This is our first real attempt at making a
group website, so please bear with us while we get things up and running. A few things
about me, because I need to fill some space: I used to be a professional cook. That's a
cook, not a chef. A chef runs a restaurant kitchen. I did not do that. Anyway, I realized
I couldn't cook forever (I'm a type 1 diabetic (there IS a difference), it was hard to
manage my health) and I decided to pursue Nuclear Engineering as a career change, and
in 2009 I enrolled at OSU as a freshman. Now I'm a graduate student and if you asked
me 10 years ago if I would expected to be doing this, I would have told you you're crazy.

My major advisor is Todd Palmer and my minor advisor is Alex Greaney.

### Alright, so here's a list of things I'm currently working on

* Dissertation
  * Deterministic phonon transport
  1. There is plenty to fill this up
  2. Some-complicated term
    * can we make sub sub lists?

What happens now?

I am beginning my 2nd year as a PhD student at Oregon State, my major advisor is Todd Palmer and my minor advisor is Alex Greaney[^1].
I defended my M.S.[^2] in October 2015, and began work toward my Ph.D. soon after that.

## Research
We are interested in simulating deterministic phonon transport using the code Rattlesnake (written in the
<a href="http://mooseframework.org/" target="blank">MOOSE</a> framework) to predict thermal conductivity in nuclear fuels operating at high temperatures with isotopic defects and evolving microstructures. We are developing a framework to bridge the gap between the atomistic and engineering scale, and collaborate with <a href="http://www.engr.ucr.edu/faculty/me/AlexanderGreaney.html" target="blank">Dr. Alex Greaney</a> of UC Riverside and <a href="https://github.com/dschwen" target="blank">Daniel Schwen</a> of
<a href="https://www.inl.gov/" target="blank">Idaho National Laboratory</a>.



We have shown Rattlesnake to be an effective and efficient engine for simulating homogeneous phonon transport; it solves the frequency independent equation of phonon radiative transfer in the Self-Adjoint Angular Flux formulation using the single mode relaxation time approximation. However, we are interested in phonon transport at high temperatures and therefore must implement multifrequency transport to model these physics effectively, in addition to considering contributions from 3- and 4-phonon processes and other anharmonic effects.

### Personal interests
I love Oregon and the west coast. I have a lot of interests but these tend to rotate based on the season and how busy
I am.

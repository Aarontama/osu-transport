I am a Ph.D. candidate in Nuclear Engineering in the [School of Nuclear Science and Engineering](https://ne.oregonstate.edu) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu). My major advisor is [Todd Palmer](https://rtrp.github.io/osu-transport/palmerts/). I am also a licenced reactor operator for the [Oregon State TRIGA Reactor](http://radiationcenter.oregonstate.edu/oregon-state-triga-reactor-0).

## Research

We have demonstrated the feasibility of high-order finite element radiation transport using meshes with curved surfaces using the open source finite element library [MFEM](https://mfem.org). The image below[^1] is of a homogeneous 2D problem with vacuum BCs, where $c = 0.999$.

With mesh refinement and/or increasing the finite element order, we see solutions converging to the analytic solution (see image[^1]).

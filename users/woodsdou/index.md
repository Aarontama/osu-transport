I am beginning my 2nd year as a PhD candidate in Nuclear Engineering in the [School of Nuclear Science and Engineering](https://ne.oregonstate.edu) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu). My major advisor is [Todd Palmer](https://rtrp.github.io/osu-transport/palmerts/).


## Education

* Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering at Oregon State University, Candidate
* M.S. in Nuclear Engineering[^1] at Oregon State University, February 2016
* B.S. in Nuclear Engineering at Oregon State University, March 2013

## Current Research

High-order finite element radiation transport using meshes with curved surfaces using the open source finite element library [MFEM](https://mfem.org).

***

## Current projects

* Dissertation
  * Currently doing literature review and collecting material for writing my dissertation proposal


* Intern at Idaho National Laboratory
  * I work for Daniel Schwen and Dan Wachs on a variety of projects
  * Some of this includes [MOOSE](http://mooseframework.org) development, modeling and simulation

***

### Conferences
* American Nuclear Society Summer Meeting, New Orleans, LA, June 2016
* American Nuclear Society Student Conference, Boston, MA, April 2014

***

### Publications
* J. HARTER, P. A. GREANEY, and T. PALMER, "Characterization of Thermal Conductivity using Deterministic Phonon Transport in Rattlesnake," *Transactions of the American Nuclear Society*, **112**, 829â€“832 (2015).

### Personal interests
I love Oregon and the west coast. I have a lot of interests but these tend to rotate based on the season and how busy
I am.

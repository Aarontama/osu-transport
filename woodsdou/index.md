## Research interests

Radiation transport, deterministic methods, high-order finite element method, diffusion synthetic acceleration (DSA)

***

## Current projects

* Dissertation
  * Currently doing literature review and collecting material for writing my dissertation proposal


* Intern at Idaho National Laboratory
  * I work for Daniel Schwen and Dan Wachs on a variety of projects
  * Some of this includes [MOOSE](http://mooseframework.org) development, modeling and simulation

***

### Conferences
* 
* American Nuclear Society Winter Meeting, Las Vegas, NV. November 2016

***

### Publications
* J. HARTER, P. A. GREANEY, and T. PALMER, "Characterization of Thermal Conductivity using Deterministic Phonon Transport in Rattlesnake," *Transactions of the American Nuclear Society*, **112**, 829â€“832 (2015).

### Personal interests
I love Oregon and the west coast. I have a lot of interests but these tend to rotate based on the season and how busy
I am.

================================

https://rtrp.github.io/osu-transport/woodsdou/

I am beginning my 2nd year as a PhD candidate in Nuclear Engineering in the [School of Nuclear Science and Engineering](https://ne.oregonstate.edu) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu). My major advisor is [Todd Palmer](https://rtrp.github.io/osu-transport/palmerts/).

I defended my M.S.[^1] in February 2016, and began work toward my PhD soon after that.

## Research interests

Boltzmann transport equation, phonon transport, deterministic methods, quantum mechanics,
thermal conductivity, uncertainty quantification, statistical thermophysics and
nuclear materials

***

## Current projects

* Dissertation
  * Currently doing literature review and collecting material for writing my dissertation proposal


* Intern at Idaho National Laboratory
  * I work for Daniel Schwen and Dan Wachs on a variety of projects
  * Some of this includes [MOOSE](http://mooseframework.org) development, modeling and simulation

***

### Upcoming conferences
* Materials Science & Technology 2016, Salt Lake City, UT. October 2016
* American Nuclear Society Winter Meeting, Las Vegas, NV. November 2016

***

### Publications
* J. HARTER, P. A. GREANEY, and T. PALMER, "Characterization of Thermal Conductivity using Deterministic Phonon Transport in Rattlesnake," *Transactions of the American Nuclear Society*, **112**, 829â€“832 (2015).

### Personal interests
I love Oregon and the west coast. I have a lot of interests but these tend to rotate based on the season and how busy
I am.
